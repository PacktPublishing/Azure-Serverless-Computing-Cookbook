**Build applications hosted on serverless architecture using Azure Functions**

## What is this book about?
Microsoft provides a solution to easily run small segment of code in the Cloud with Azure Functions. Azure Functions provides solutions for processing data, integrating systems, and building simple APIs and microservices.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Develop different event-based handlers supported by serverless architecture supported by Microsoft Cloud Platform – Azure
* Integrate Azure Functions with different Azure Services to develop Enterprise-level applications
* Get to know the best practices in organizing and refactoring the code within the Azure functions
* Test, troubleshoot, and monitor the Azure functions to deliver high-quality, reliable, and robust cloud-centric applications
* Automate mundane tasks at various levels right from development to deployment and maintenance
* Learn how to develop statefulserverless applications and also self-healing jobs using DurableFunctions

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
private static Dictionary<ImageSize, Tuple<int, int>> imageDimensionsTable = new Dictionary<ImageSize, Tuple<int,         
         int>>()
        {
            { ImageSize.Small, Tuple.Create(100, 100) },
            { ImageSize.Medium, Tuple.Create(200, 200) }
        };
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
